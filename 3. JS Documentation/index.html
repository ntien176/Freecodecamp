                    <p class="main-section__item--content">JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting
                        language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web
                        browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic
                        control over them.</p>
                    <p class="main-section__item--content">JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as
                        Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control
                        structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by
                        supplementing it with additional objects; for example:</p>

                        <li class="main-section__item--content-li">Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by
                            supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example,
                            client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and respond to
                            user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.</li>

                            supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example, server-side

                            information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations

                        <li class="main-section__item--content-li">A general understanding of the Internet and the World Wide Web (WWW).</li>

                    <p class="main-section__item--content">JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
                    <p class="main-section__item--content">In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of objects, executing as loosely typed methods.</p>
                    <p class="main-section__item--content">JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables, parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.</p>
